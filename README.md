**Dog Breed Classification: 
**
This project aims to classify dog breeds using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on image data. The project is built using PyTorch Lightning, and Hydra is used for configuration management. The repo also includes test evaluation using a checkpointed model and inference capabilities. Additionally, code coverage (using Codecov) and Docker containerization are integrated.

Key Features

- **PyTorch Lightning Framework**: Utilizes PyTorch Lightning for efficient model training and management.
- **Hydra**: dynamic configuration usuing Hydra.
- **Docker Containerization**: Includes Docker setup for easy deployment and reproducibility across different environments.
- **Code Cover & Pytest**: Ensure robust code quality by integrating pytest and Codecov for automated testing and achieving 70% or higher test coverage.
- **GHRC integration**: deploy and manage Docker image with GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for seamless integration and versioning.
